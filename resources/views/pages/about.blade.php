                    <h4>About the Contest</h4>
                </div>
                The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) traces
                its roots to a competition held at Texas A&M in 1970 hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer
                Science Honor Society. The idea quickly gained popularity within the United States and Canada as an
                innovative initiative to assist in the development of top students in the emerging field of computer
                science.
                <br><br>
                The contest evolved into a multi-tier competition with the first Finals held at the ACM Computer Science
                Conference in 1977. Headquartered at Baylor University since the 1980s, the contest has expanded into a
                global network of universities hosting regional competitions that advance teams to the World Finals.
                <br><br>
                Since IBM began its sponsorship of the ACM-ICPC World Finals in 1997, the contest has increased by a
                factor of 7.5. Participation has grown to involve several tens of thousands of the finest students and
                faculty in computing disciplines at 1,756 universities from 82 countries on six continents.
                <br><br>
                The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs, and enables
                students to test their ability to perform under pressure. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and
                most prestigious programming contest in the world.
                <br><br>
                Highschool contests:
                <br>
                Highschool students over the past years, proved to be of the most contributing members of ACM society.
                Nowadays there are student branches everywhere in computer community; ACM itself has a designated student
                branch. All these, result in a wide variety of programming contests, aiming specifically the students. Thus, we in the
                Student Scientific Chapter of Amirkabir university of technology, felt the absence of such contest in a higher level and
                decided to make a contest in which all students from different cities and schools can attend and compete in
                a way that's right and challenging.
