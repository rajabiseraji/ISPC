                    The national Student Programming Contest (ISPC) provides  highschool students with
                    opportunities to interact with students from  other highschools and to sharpen and demonstrate their
                    problem-solving, programming, and teamwork skills. The contest provides  a platform for ACM, industry,
                    and academia to encourage and focus  public attention on the next generation of computing professionals
                    as they pursue excellence.

                    The language of the Contest is English. All written contest  materials will be in English. Additional
                    languages may be used in contests. Terms which have undefined or different meanings
                    outside the United States must be defined or redefined appropriately in  that region's Region-Specific
                    Rules. Rules may vary at the regional  level to accommodate these differences.

                <h5 id="section-Regional+Rules-TeamComposition">Team Composition</h5>
                <p>
                    A representative of the highschool,  typically a teacher or school board member, must
                    serve as or designate the team coach.  The coach certifies the eligibility of contestants and serves
                    as the  official point-of-contact with the team prior to and during contest  activities. A team may
                    only have one coach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The coach must fully register teams in the <a href="http://ispc.aut.ac.ir">ISPC Registration System</a>
                    within the time set by the rules. A team is not eligible to compete in the
                    contest until the contest director has accepted the  team in the web registration
                    system. Teams failing to comply with any  of these requirements will be ruled ineligible to compete.
                    Only  registered reserves may be substituted for contestants. Such  substitutions must be entered in
                    the ISPC Registration System by the  regional contest director before the contest begins.
                </p>
                <p>Each team consists of three contestants who are eligible to compete in the ISPC.
                    The team's contestants must satisfy the following eligibility rules. </p>
                <h5> <strong>Contestant Eligibility Rules</strong> </h5>
                <p>Please refer to the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules/EligibilityDecisionTree-2014.pdf">Eligibility Decision Tree</a> to more easily determine eligibility </p>
                <h5><strong>Basic Requirements</strong> </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A student must be willing and able to compete in the ISPC. </li>
                    <li>A student may compete for only one highschool during a contest. </li>
                </ul>

                <h5><strong>Period of Eligibility</strong> </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A student who meets the Basic Requirements and  FIRST began highschool in  2010  or later is eligible to compete. </li>
                    <li>A student who meets the Basic Requirements and was born in  1993  or later is eligible to compete. </li>
                </ul>
                <h5><strong>Extending the Period of Eligibility</strong> </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A coach may petition the ISPC Eligibility Committee to extend the Period of Eligibility for a student
                        whose full-time  studies have been interrupted or extended.
                        This includes military or  civilian service, illness, work/studies, or personal reasons. </li>
                    <li>The coach must demonstrate that such an extension would not provide an unfair advantage to the team. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h5 id="section-Regional+Rules-ConductOfARegionalContest">Conduct of a  Contest</h5>
                <p>Solutions to problems submitted for judging are called runs. Each  run is judged as accepted or rejected by a judge, and the team is  notified of the results. </p>
                <p>Notification of accepted runs may be suspended at an appropriate  time to keep the final results secret. A general announcement to that  effect will be made during the contest. Notification of rejected runs  will continue until the end of the contest. </p>
                <p>A contestant may submit a claim of ambiguity or error in a problem  statement by submitting a clarification request to a judge. If the  judges agree that an ambiguity or error exists, a clarification will be  issued to all contestants. </p>
                <p>Contestants are not to converse with anyone except members of their  team and personnel designated by the regional contest director. Systems  support staff may advise contestants on system-related problems such as  explaining system error messages. </p>
                <p>While the contest is scheduled for a particular time length  (typically five hours), the regional contest director has the authority  to alter the length of the contest in the event of unforeseen  difficulties. Should the contest duration be altered, every attempt  will be made to notify contestants in a timely and uniform manner. </p>
                <p>A team may be disqualified by the regional contest director for any  activity that jeopardizes the contest such as dislodging extension  cords, unauthorized modification of contest materials, or distracting  behavior. </p>
                <p>At least six problems will be posed. So far as possible, problems  will avoid dependence on detailed knowledge of a particular  applications area or particular contest language. </p>
                <br>
                <h5 id="section-Regional+Rules-ScoringOfARegionalContest">Scoring of a Contest</h5>
                <p>A problem is solved when it is accepted by the judges. The judges  are solely responsible for accepting or rejecting submitted runs. In  consultation with the judges, the Contest Director determines  the winners of the contest. The contest director and  judges are empowered to adjust for or adjudicate unforeseen events and  conditions. Their decisions are final. </p>
                <p>Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved. For the  purposes of awards, or in determining qualifier(s) for the World  Finals, teams who solve the same number of problems are ranked by least  total time. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each  problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time  elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the  accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every rejected run for that  problem regardless of submittal time. There is no time consumed for a  problem that is not solved. </p>
                <p>It is the responsibility of the Contest Director to specify  any additional tie-breakers. Tie-breaker policies must be announced to  contestants before the contest begins. </p>
                <br>
                <h5 id="section-Regional+Rules-RegionalContestComputingEnvironment"> Contest Computing Environment</h5>
                <p>The programming languages of the contest will include  C/C++. Additional programming languages may be used. </p>
                <p>Each team will use a single workstation. The contest  director is responsible for determining that teams have reasonably  equivalent computing resources. </p>
                <p>Each Contest Director determines whether contestants may  bring materials for use during the contest. Please see the specific  rules at the ISPC Contest Web Site.
                    Each team will be permitted to provide a PDF of up to 25 pages of notes  within the limits described during Team Certification. Three copies  will be printed and placed at the team's workstation for use during the  contest. </p>
                <br>
